# Election Data Scraper & Analysis

## Overview
This project involves developing a **Python web scraping script** to extract **voting projections** of political parties across **336 districts**. The collected data is then analyzed to compare the **projected margin of victory** with **voter turnout**, helping to identify **strategic areas** for influencing election outcomes effectively.

## Features
- **Web Scraping:** Extracts election projections from multiple online sources.
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Formats and structures the collected data for analysis.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Analyzes the projected margin of victory alongside voter turnout.
- **Visualization:** Generates insights using charts and graphs to highlight key findings.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Libraries:**
  - `requests` - For making HTTP requests to web pages.
  - `BeautifulSoup` - For parsing and extracting data from HTML.
  - `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - For data visualization.
  - `numpy` - For numerical operations.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/election-data-scraper.git
   cd election-data-scraper
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Scraper:**
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```
   - This script will fetch the latest election projections and store the data in a CSV file.

2. **Run the Analysis:**
   ```bash
   python analyze.py
   ```
   - This script will process and analyze the scraped data, identifying trends and insights.

3. **View Results:**
   - The processed data and visualizations will be saved in the `output/` directory.
