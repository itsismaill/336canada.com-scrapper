# Election Data Scraper & Analysis

## Overview

This project involves developing a **Python web scraping script** to extract **voting projections** of political parties across **338 districts**. The collected data is then analyzed to compare the **projected margin of victory** with **voter turnout**, helping to identify **strategic areas** for influencing election outcomes effectively.

## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Extracts election projections from multiple online sources.
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Formats and structures the collected data for analysis.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Analyzes the projected margin of victory alongside voter turnout.
- **Visualization:** Generates insights using charts and graphs to highlight key findings.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Libraries:**
  - `requests` - For making HTTP requests to web pages.
  - `BeautifulSoup` - For parsing and extracting data from HTML.
  - `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - For data visualization.
  - `numpy` - For numerical operations.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsismaill/336canada-projections-scrapper.git
   cd 336canada-projections-scrapper
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Scraper:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 336canada-projections-scrapper.ipynb
   ```

   - Open the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells sequentially to fetch the latest election projections and store the data in a CSV file.

2. **Run the Analysis:**

   - The notebook contains analysis sections that process and visualize the scraped data, identifying trends and insights.

3. **View Results:**

   - The processed data and visualizations will be saved in the `output/` directory.
